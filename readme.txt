With this Plugin you could connect your Tumblr account on your WordPress blog

== Description ==

With this Plugin you could connect your Tumblr account on your WordPress blog, so you can view the discussion of your 
Tumber into a post or a page of your WordPress Blog.

The reason for the construction of the Plugin was a user of our Forum, calling for help in linking the Tumblr with his 
WordPress blog. So rather than get in the process of explaining the complex process of linking, we create the wp-tumblr-embeder 
doing the same thing, easier and faster.

About Tumblr

Tumblr is a microblogging platform that allows users to post text, images, videos, links, quotes and audio to their tumblelog, 
a short-form blog. Users can follow other users, or choose to make their tumblelog private. The service emphasizes ease of use.

Tumblr emphasis is on customization and ease of use, with a relatively simple sign-up process. There are many forms of 
content that can be added to the users own tumblelog; the seven general categories for posts include Text, Photo, Quote, Link, 
Chat, Audio, and Video. Users follow other tumblelogs, much like on Twitter, and their updates appear in one stream on the Dashboard
